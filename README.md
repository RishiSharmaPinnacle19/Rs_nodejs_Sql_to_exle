The code connects to a MySQL database using specified credentials and retrieves data from the "employees" table. Upon a successful connection, it executes a query to select all records from the table. The results are then converted into an Excel worksheet format. A new Excel workbook is created, and the worksheet is added to this workbook. Finally, the workbook is saved as "employees.xlsx," and the database connection is closed.
